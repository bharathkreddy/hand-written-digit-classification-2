# digit-draw-recognize

This is my project on digit recognition. You draw a digit and models try to recognize it. There are two models: FNN on numpy and CNN on Tensorflow. Also models not simply recognize digits, but also train on them. As a result quality of predictions continue improving.
The site works on desktop and mobile.

You can find descriptions of the models and the project itself on the site.

This is an old repo: tensorflow model starts breaking (can't load updated checkpoints due to problems with hash), here is a newer version in Pytorch:
